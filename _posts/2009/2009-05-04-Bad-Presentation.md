Today I attend a really boring presentation. It was scheduled for one hour, but it took me two more hours in fact.  I  stayed until it ended only because I just joined this company and didn't want to be rude. The lecturer wanted to tell us everything he knew including truly basic concepts for the audiences.  What made it worse is that there were something totally wrong: Regarding transactions in Java EE, he said it supported nested transaction. But indeed, it is said in Sun's document. 

[However, the Java EE transaction manager does have one limitation: it does not support nested transactions.](http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-3669/bncih?a=view)
