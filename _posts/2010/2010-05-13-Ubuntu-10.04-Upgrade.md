After I upgraded my Ubuntu to 10.04, I found that the sun-java6 package was removed from repository which means you can't get it by running "sudo apt-get install sun-java6". I did the Google search, and found following statement from 10.04 LTS [release notes](http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/1004#Sun%20Java%20moved%20to%20the%20Partner%20repository): 

>**Sun Java moved to the Partner repository**

Now, if you want to install sun-java6, you have to do the following steps: 

1. add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ lucid partner" 
2. sudo apt-get update 
3. sudo apt-get install sun-java6 sun-java6-plugin 
4. sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-6-sun
