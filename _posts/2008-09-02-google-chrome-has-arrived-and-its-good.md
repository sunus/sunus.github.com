Today Brian Rakowski [announced the launch][] of Google’s new browser,
[Chrome][]. After teasing us yesterday with a great [comic book strip][]
explaining what it is, how it works and the ideas behind it they finally
opened up downloads at around 8pm(GMT).

## The Good

-   Its fast! Websites seems really snappy. Ive yet to run any
    benchmarks yet but I can see it beating Firefox and Safari in all
    areas
-   Lightweight. I was a bit unsure of having multiple processes running
    all over my machine but they seem to managed well. RAM usage can
    get a bit high with multiple tabs open but with just GMail open its
    only using 17mb (vs FF3’s 112mb)
-   Standards compliant. It’s got [WebKit][] under the hood so this was
    expected really.

## The bad

-   The installation procedure is awful. Why do I have to download a
    500k setup file which then in turn downloads the installation file
    and extracts it to a random location on my hard drive. Getting
    installation right is very important as it’s often the first
    interaction a user will be having with your application.
-   Im running Windows XP and the GUI is some kind of Vista hybrid (just
    like Windows Live Messenger). Although its fairly minimal it does
    annoy me.
-   They’ve adopted the IE7 style of doing away with the File, Edit,
    Help menu and placing it all under one icon. At least give us the
    option to change it back guys.
-   No “Add to dictionary” feature when you right click on a misspelled
    word. Bit of an oversight really.

The good points really do outweigh the few bad points mentioned here. I
feel guilty dropping [Firefox][] after championing it for so many years
but it has become bloated and unstable.

I’ll be looking forward to new updates and plugins over the coming
weeks.
