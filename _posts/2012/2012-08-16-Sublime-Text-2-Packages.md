I heard about [sublime text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) months before. Everyone said it is great. But I didn't give it a try because I think it is just another editor. Yesterday while I was trying to learn python by following [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/), I decided to use it and found out it does work great. Here are some useful packages/plugin I liked very much. 

* [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control#Features)
The first package you should install. It is a package manager which allows you install/remove packages. 

* Theme - Soda
Popular theme. It can be install though package control.

* alternative_autocompletion
Textmate like autocompletion. t can be install though package control.

* SublimeRope
Python autocompletion. t can be install though package control.

* SublimePythonTidy
Python code formatter. Installing it though package control doesn't work. Read the instrution in [here](https://github.com/witsch/SublimePythonTidy/) to install it manually.

* Hide the Sidebar
cmd+K, cmd+B
